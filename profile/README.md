## ROBOKOP: Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways

### Introduction

ROBOKOP is a publicly available collection of harmonized biological, chemical, and medical knowledge bases.   These knowledge bases are created from other publicly available sources and transformed into a harmonized collection by the [ORION](http://github.com/ROBOKOPU24/ORION) pipeline.  These individual KGs are then merged into a single large KG: ROBOKOP KG.   Each source and aggregate graph is represented as a Knowledge Graph (KG) and each of these KGs is exposed with a common set of APIs for public use by Plater.  The ROBOKOP KG can also be queried by a user freindly interface.  This interface and links to the APIs can be found at http://robokop.renci.org.
